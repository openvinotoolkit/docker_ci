3. Python cpython


A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE FOR WINDOWS CONTAINER BASE IMAGE
This Supplemental License is for the Windows Container Base Image (“Container Image”). If you comply with the terms of this Supplemental License you may use the Container Image as described below.
CONTAINER OS IMAGE
The Container Image may only be used with a validly licensed copy of:
Windows Server Standard or Windows Server Datacenter software (collectively “Server Host Software”), or Microsoft Windows Operating System (version 10) software (“Client Host Software”), or Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and Windows 10 IoT Core (collectively “IoT Host Software”). The Server Host Software, Client Host Software, and IoT Host Software are collectively referred to as the “Host Software” and a license for Host Software is a "Host License".
You may not use the Container Image if you do not have a corresponding version and edition of the Host License. Certain restrictions and additional terms may apply, which are described herein. If licensing terms herein conflict with Host License, then this Supplemental License shall govern with respect to the Container Image. BY ACCEPTING THIS SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE OR USING THE CONTAINER IMAGE, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTAINER IMAGE.
DEFINITIONS
Windows Server Container (without Hyper-V isolation) is a feature of Microsoft Windows Server software.
Windows Server Container with Hyper-V isolation. Section 2(k) of the Microsoft Windows Server license terms is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the revised terms as shown in “UPDATED” below.
UPDATED: Windows Server Container with Hyper-V isolation (formerly known as Hyper-V Container) is a container technology in Windows Server which utilizes a virtual operating system environment to host one or more Windows Server Container(s). Each Hyper-V isolation instance used to host one or more Windows Server Container(s) is considered one virtual operating system environment.
LICENSE TERMS
Host License. The Host License terms apply to your use of the Container Image and any Windows container(s) created with the Container Image which are distinct and separate from a virtual machine.
Use Rights. The Container Image may be used to create an isolated virtualized Windows operating system environment that includes at least one application that adds primary and significant functionality. You may use the Container Image only to create, build, and run Windows container(s) on Host Software. Updates to the Host Software may not update the Container Image so you may re-create any Windows containers based on an updated Container Image.
Restrictions. You may not remove this Supplemental License document file from the Container Image. You may not enable remote access to the application(s) you run within your container to avoid applicable license fees. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Container Image, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing the use of certain open-source components that may be included with the software. Additional restrictions in the Host License may apply.
ADDITIONAL TERMS
Client Host Software. When running a Container Image on Client Host Software you may run any number of the Container Image instantiated as Windows containers for test or development purposes only. You may not use these Windows containers in a production environment on Client Host Software.
IoT Host Software. When running a Container Image on IoT Host Software you may run any number of the Container Image instantiated as Windows containers for test or development purposes only. You may only use the Container Image in a production environment if you have agreed to the Microsoft Commercial Terms of Use for Windows 10 Core Runtime Images or the Windows 10 IoT Enterprise Device License (“Windows IoT Commercial Agreement”). Additional terms and restrictions in the Windows IoT Commercial Agreements apply to your use of Container Image in a production environment.
Third Party Software. The Container Image may include third party applications that are licensed to you under this Supplemental License or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third-party applications may be accessible online at https://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices or in an accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages in the Host License also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.
Open Source Components. The Container Image may contain third party copyrighted software licensed under open source licenses with source code availability obligations. Copies of those licenses are included in the ThirdPartyNotices file or other accompanying notices file. You may obtain the complete corresponding source code from Microsoft if and as required under the relevant open source license by sending a money order or check for $5.00 to: Source Code Compliance Team, Microsoft Corporation, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, USA.
