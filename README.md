# DockerHub CI for [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino)

The Framework can generate a Dockerfile, build, test, and deploy an image with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit.
You can reuse available Dockerfiles, add your layer and customize the image of OpenVINO™ for your needs.

## Documentation

* [Get Started with OpenVINO™ toolkit images](get-started.md)
* [Available Dockerfiles for OpenVINO™ toolkit](dockerfiles)
* [Generating the dockerfiles and building the images](docs/openvino_docker.md)
* [Working with OpenVINO containers](docs/containers.md)
* [Deployment with GPU accelerators](docs/accelerators.md)
* [Available Tutorials](docs/tutorials)

As [Docker\*](https://docs.docker.com/) is (mostly) just an isolation tool, the OpenVINO toolkit inside the container is the same as the OpenVINO toolkit installed natively on the host machine,
so the [OpenVINO documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/) is fully applicable to containerized OpenVINO distribution.

## Supported Operating Systems for Docker Base Image:

 - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
 - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
 - RedHat UBI 8
